        <p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to
          give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?),
          structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation
          menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of
          these, and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>
        <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
        <p>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing
          angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the start
          of the paragraph is.
          The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the
          element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to
          include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to strange results.
          The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.
          The element: The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.</p>

          We've looked at a lot of text so far in this course, but the web would be really boring only using text. Let's
          start looking at how to make the web come alive with more interesting content! This module explores how to use
          HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and
          how
          to embed video, audio, and even entire webpages.

          A very common task in HTML is structuring tabular data, and it has a number of elements and attributes for
          just
          this purpose. Coupled with a little CSS for styling, HTML makes it easy to display tables of information on
          the
          web such as your school lesson plan, the timetable at your local swimming pool, or statistics about your
          favorite dinosaurs or football team. This module takes you through all you need to know about structuring
          tabular data using HTML.

          This module provides a series of articles that will help you master HTML forms. HTML forms are a very powerful
          tool for interacting with users; however, for historical and technical reasons, it's not always obvious how to
          use them to their full potential. In this guide, we'll cover all aspects of HTML forms, from structure to
          styling, from data handling to custom widgets.
